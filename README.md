# OSU-Unit04-CodeQuiz
A coding quiz with multiple choice questions &amp; a countdown timer.

When the user clicks the start button, a countdown timer starts as a coding question appears on screen followed by four multiple choice answers.

When the user clicks on an answer, a new question and set of answers appears. 

If the answer is correct, the user earns 5 points which are displayed on the top of the page. If it is incorrect, a 10 second time penalty is applied.

Once the user answers all of the questions, their final score is displayed and they are asked to enter their initials into a text box. 

As the user clicks the submit button, their final score and initials are saved into the local storage on their computer and they are taken to the highscore page where they are displayed.

The highscore page also features a back and clear button. The back button takes the user back to the main site where they can retake the quiz. The clear button clears the local storage and removes the highscores from the page.
